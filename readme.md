## Introduction

Insurance companies handle a vast amount of claims every day. Accurate predictions of claim payments are crucial for risk assessment and decision-making. This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging Machine Learning to make more precise claim payment predictions.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: We've used the Linear Regression algorithm to build the predictive model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed to handle categorical features like ICD-10 codes and the type of work.
- **Predictive Accuracy**: The model has shown significant accuracy in predicting claim payments.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can find them in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. **Dataset**: Prepare your dataset or use the sample dataset provided in the `data` folder. Ensure that your dataset contains the necessary columns, such as ICD-10 codes, age, and type of work.

4. **Training the Model**: Train the model with your dataset by running the training script.

5. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions for claim payments based on the features of your choice.

## Usage

You can use this project for various purposes, such as:

- Predicting claim payments for insurance companies.
- Analyzing the impact of different factors on claim payments.
